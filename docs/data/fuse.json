Dendron is a developer-focused knowledge base that helps you manage information using **flexible hierarchies**!\n\nYou are currently in the tutorial vault (a vault is the folder where your notes are stored). Feel free to edit this note and create new files as you go through the quickstart!\n\n## Create a Note\n\n1. Use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to bring up the lookup prompt\n1. Type `dendron` and select `Create New`\n\n- > NOTE: After you press enter, Dendron will create and open the `dendron` note. Use `<CTRL>-<TAB>` to come back to this note\n\nYou just created your first note!\n\n- > NOTE: Notes in Dendron are just plain text markdown with some [frontmatter](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ffec2853-c0e0-4165-a368-339db12c8e4b) on the top. You can edit them in Dendron or using ~~vim~~ your favourite text editor.\n\n## Find a Note\n\n1. Use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to bring up the lookup prompt again\n1. Type `dendron` and press `<ENTER>`\n\n- > TIP: you don't have to type out the entire query, press `<TAB>` to autocomplete\n\nYou just `looked up` a note!\n\n- > NOTE: in Dendron, you can find or create notes using the lookup prompt\n\n## Organize your Notes\n\n1. Bring up the lookup prompt again\n1. Type `tutorial.one`\n\nYou just created your first hierarchy!\n\n- > NOTE: hierarchies in Dendron are just `.` delimited files. This makes each note both a file and a folder and makes it easy to keep your notes organized\n\n- > TIP: You can use the [Dendron Tree View](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hur7r6gr3kqa56s2vme986j) to view your hierarchy. If it's not currently in focus, you can use `CTRL+SHIFT+P`/`CMD+SHIFT+P` to open the command prompt and type in `Dendron: focus on tree view` to make it appear\n\n## Create a link\n\n1. In the current note, type `[[` - this should trigger the autocomplete. You can type `one` to narrow it down to the note you just created and hit enter\n<!-- Enter '[[' below-->\n\n<!-- End space-->\n\nYou just created your first link!\n\n- > NOTE: the links with the `[[` are called wikilinks (because they were first popularized by Wikipedia)\n- > TIP: If you hover your mouse over the link, you can get a preview of the contents inside the note!\n\n## Navigate a link\n\n1. Move your text cursor over the link you just created. Hold down `<CTRL>+<ENTER>`/`<CMD>+<ENTER>`\n\n- > TIP: You can also use `CTRL+CLICK` or `CMD+CLICK` to navigate links via mouse\n\nYou just navigated the link!\n\n## Refactor a Note\n\n1. Open [[tutorial.one]], bring up the command prompt (`CTRL+SHIFT+P`/`CMD+SHIFT+P`) and type `Dendron: Rename Note`\n1. Replace `tutorial` with `my-note` and then press `<ENTER>`\n1. You just refactored the note!\n\n- > NOTE: when you rename a note, Dendron updates all links and references of the original note being renamed. Try switching back to [[tutorial]] to see the updated link!\n- > TIP: in addition to renaming one note at a time, dendron has [an entire collection](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/srajljj10V2dl19nCSFiC) of refactoring commands that let you change headers, move around sections, and refactor entire hierarchies!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats, you finished the Dendron tutorial!\n\nWas there anything **unclear or buggy** about this tutorial?
